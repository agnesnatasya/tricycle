Added `tricycle.TreeVar`, which acts like a context variable that is
inherited at nursery creation time (and then by child tasks of that
nursery) rather than at task creation time. :ref:`Tree variables
<tree-variables>` are useful for providing safe 'ambient' access to a
resource that is tied to an ``async with`` block in the parent task,
such as an open file or trio-asyncio event loop.
